# fmi-3d

The FMI-3D project was initiated in 2012 and completed in 2013.
The result of the project was a library for genration of 3D objects
and a collection of over 300 interactive models covering wide spectrum
of CG topics. FMI-3D was heavily used in the course "Fundamentals of
Computer Graphics" for Computer Sciences undergraduates students from the
[Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng). After several
years of years of faithful serviceuse FMI-3D was retired with honors and
replaced by a next generation library on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

# Source code

The code is written in C/C++ and uses two external libraries -- OpenGL 1.x,
which was present on all systems at that time, and an old version of GLFW, which
is included in this repository for convenience. The compilation was done by GCC
and managed by CodeBlocks. The project files (*.cbp) for all models are also
included in the repository.

# License

The source code of FMI-3D is made open as a form of software heritage.
The project and the code is not maintained any more. The exact license
is not decided yet, however, the code can be used/reused in any type of
non-commercial or educational project, provided there is proper 
acknowledgement.
